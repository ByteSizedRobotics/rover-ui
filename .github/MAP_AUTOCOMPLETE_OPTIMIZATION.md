# Map Autocomplete & Routing Improvements

## Overview
Recent updates streamline the map planning page (`src/routes/map/[id]/+page.svelte`) to make route planning faster, local to the user, and more reliable. The work focuses on three pillars:

1. **User-scoped search** – Restrict queries to the visitor’s surrounding city and a small bounding box.
2. **Suggestion responsiveness** – Abort in-flight lookups, cache results, and prefer structured queries for numbered addresses.
3. **Routing reuse** – Eliminate redundant geocoding once a suggestion is chosen and smooth out map initialization.

## Key Changes

### 1. Geolocation Bootstrap
- Uses `navigator.geolocation` on mount to center the Leaflet map against the user’s coordinates.
- Computes a ~5 km bounding box (`computeBoundingBox`) used to scope Nominatim searches.
- Performs a reverse lookup to capture the current **city** and **province/state**, feeding that into every subsequent query.
- Gracefully falls back to the broader Canada search if the browser blocks location access.

### 2. Structured Autocomplete Fetches
- `buildSearchParams()` converts user input into street + house number parameters and adds the bounded city/state filters.
- `fetchSuggestions()` now:
  - Aborts previous requests via `AbortController`.
  - Retrieves `jsonv2` results with `addressdetails` for consistent formatting.
  - Caches responses locally (`Map<string, NominatimResult[]>`) keyed by normalized query + locality.
  - Filters out entries that lack a house number, ensuring suggestions look like `"123 Main St, Ottawa, Ontario"`.

### 3. Faster Route Selection
- When a suggestion is clicked, its latitude/longitude are stored (`selectedStartCoords`, `selectedEndCoords`).
- `setRoute()` reuses those coordinates instead of re-hitting the geocoder, cutting out redundant network hops.
- Leaflet routing and geocoder plugins load in parallel (`Promise.all`) to reduce boot time.

### 4. Defensive UX Touches
- Start/end suggestion panels only open when results exist and close via small timeouts to allow clicks.
- Debounces remain at 300 ms to avoid rate-limiting while still feeling responsive.
- Geocoding failures and missing route data surface alerts to guide the user.

## Usage Notes
1. The first page load may prompt for location access. Denying it simply widens search scope; consider teaching operators to allow it for best accuracy.
2. Cached suggestions are per-session; refreshing the page clears them.
3. The routing UI still requires the Leaflet CSS/JS hosted via CDN. If the team later self-hosts assets, update the on-mount CSS injector accordingly.

## Testing & Verification Checklist
- ✅ Confirm geolocation prompt appears and centers map near the tester’s coordinates (or logs a graceful warning if blocked).
- ✅ Type a numbered street (e.g., `"150 Elgin"`) and observe suggestions with full address numbers restricted to the local city.
- ✅ Select a suggestion and click **Set Route**; the map should render the polyline without extra geocoding.
- ✅ Launching the rover continues to stash waypoints in `sessionStorage` under `launch_waypoints_{roverId}`.
- ⚠️ Optional: run `npm run check` / `npm run lint` to ensure SvelteKit typings and lint rules still pass in your environment.

## Follow-Up Opportunities
- Surface a toast when geolocation fails so the operator understands searches are in “wide mode.”
- Persist geolocation + city data in local storage to skip prompt when re-entering the page.
- Add analytics to log average suggestion latency and cache hit rates.
- Consider lazy-loading the routing plugin on the first **Set Route** click if startup time needs further trimming.
