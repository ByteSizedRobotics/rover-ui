# Connection Logic Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Fix 1: `_isConnected` Not Set to False on Error

**Before:**
```typescript
this._socket.onerror = (error) => {
    this._connectionErrors++;
    console.error('Connection error:', error);
    reject(new Error('Failed to connect'));
    // ❌ _isConnected not set to false!
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
this._socket.onerror = (error) => {
    this._connectionErrors++;
    this._isConnected = false;  // ✅ Fixed!
    console.error(`Connection error for rover ${this._roverId}:`, error);
    
    // Clean up socket and stop heartbeat
    this.stopHeartbeat();
    if (this._socket) {
        this._socket.onclose = null;  // Prevent race with onclose
        this._socket.onerror = null;
        this._socket.onmessage = null;
        this._socket.onopen = null;
    }
    
    this.notifyStateChange();
    reject(new Error('Failed to connect to ROS2 Command Center'));
};
```

**Impact:** `_isConnected` now accurately reflects connection state even when errors occur.

---

### ✅ Fix 2: Race Condition Between `onerror` and `onclose` Fixed

**Before:**
- Both handlers could fire in undefined order
- Both would set `_isConnected = false` (duplicate)
- Both would call `notifyStateChange()` (duplicate)
- `onclose` would fire even after `onerror` handled the error

**After:**
- `onerror` handler removes the `onclose` handler immediately
- Only one handler processes the disconnection
- Single state change notification
- No race condition

**Code:**
```typescript
// In onerror handler:
this._socket.onclose = null;  // ✅ Prevents onclose from firing
```

---

### ✅ Fix 3: `disconnect()` No Longer Causes Duplicate Events

**Before:**
```typescript
disconnect(): void {
    this.stopHeartbeat();
    this.disconnectWebRTC();
    
    if (this._socket) {
        this.unsubscribeFromAllTopics();
        this._socket.close();  // ❌ Triggers onclose handler
        this._socket = null;
    }
    
    this._isConnected = false;  // After onclose already set it
    this.notifyStateChange();   // Duplicate notification!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
disconnect(): void {
    // Track if state changed
    const wasConnected = this._isConnected;
    
    // Set state FIRST
    this._isConnected = false;
    
    this.stopHeartbeat();
    this.disconnectWebRTC();

    if (this._socket) {
        // ✅ Remove handlers BEFORE closing
        this._socket.onclose = null;
        this._socket.onerror = null;
        this._socket.onmessage = null;
        this._socket.onopen = null;
        
        this.unsubscribeFromAllTopics();
        
        if (this._socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN || 
            this._socket.readyState === WebSocket.CONNECTING) {
            this._socket.close();
        }
        this._socket = null;
    }

    // ✅ Only notify if state changed
    if (wasConnected) {
        console.log(`Disconnected from rover ${this._roverId}`);
        this.notifyStateChange();
    }
}
```

**Impact:** 
- No duplicate `onclose` events
- No duplicate state change notifications
- Clean, predictable disconnection

### ✅ Fix 4: Improved `connect()` with Socket Cleanup

**Before:**
```typescript
async connect(): Promise<void> {
    if (this._isConnected) {  // ❌ Only checks _isConnected
        return;
    }
    
    // ❌ Doesn't clean up existing socket
    // ❌ Could have multiple sockets in memory
    
    this._socket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
    // ...
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
async connect(): Promise<void> {
    // ✅ Check both _isConnected AND socket state
    if (this._isConnected && this._socket?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        console.log(`Already connected for rover ${this._roverId}`);
        return;
    }

    // ✅ Clean up any existing socket before reconnecting
    if (this._socket) {
        console.log(`Cleaning up existing socket for rover ${this._roverId}`);
        this._socket.onclose = null;
        this._socket.onerror = null;
        this._socket.onmessage = null;
        this._socket.onopen = null;
        if (this._socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN || 
            this._socket.readyState === WebSocket.CONNECTING) {
            this._socket.close();
        }
        this._socket = null;
    }

    // ✅ Ensure clean state
    this._isConnected = false;
    
    // Now create new connection
    this._socket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
    // ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- No memory leaks from dangling sockets
- Safe to call `connect()` multiple times
- Proper cleanup before reconnection

## State Management Flow (After Fixes)

### Connection Success Flow
```
1. connect() called
   ├─ Check if already connected (both _isConnected AND socket state)
   ├─ Clean up old socket if exists
   └─ _isConnected = false (clean state)

2. new WebSocket(url)
   └─ readyState = CONNECTING (0)

3. onopen fires
   ├─ _isConnected = true ✅
   ├─ Subscribe to topics
   ├─ Start heartbeat
   └─ notifyStateChange() #1

Connection established!
```

### Connection Error Flow
```
1. connect() called
   └─ new WebSocket(url)

2. onerror fires (network issue, wrong URL, etc.)
   ├─ _isConnected = false ✅
   ├─ stopHeartbeat()
   ├─ Remove ALL event handlers (prevents onclose)
   ├─ notifyStateChange() #1
   └─ reject Promise

3. onclose does NOT fire (handler removed)

Clean error state, no duplicates!
```

### Disconnection Flow
```
1. disconnect() called
   ├─ wasConnected = _isConnected
   ├─ _isConnected = false ✅ (FIRST!)
   ├─ stopHeartbeat()
   └─ disconnectWebRTC()

2. Remove all socket event handlers
   ├─ onclose = null
   ├─ onerror = null
   ├─ onmessage = null
   └─ onopen = null

3. Close socket
   └─ No events fire (handlers removed)

4. Only if wasConnected
   └─ notifyStateChange() #1

Clean disconnect, single notification!
```

### Reconnection Flow
```
1. connect() called (already have socket)
   ├─ Check: _isConnected = false, socket exists
   └─ Clean up existing socket
      ├─ Remove handlers
      ├─ Close socket
      └─ socket = null

2. Create new connection
   └─ Fresh WebSocket with clean state

No conflicts, no memory leaks!
```

## WebSocket State Reference

Understanding `readyState`:
```typescript
WebSocket.CONNECTING = 0  // Connection in progress
WebSocket.OPEN       = 1  // Connected and ready
WebSocket.CLOSING    = 2  // close() called, closing
WebSocket.CLOSED     = 3  // Closed or failed to open
```

**Safe to close:** States 0 (CONNECTING) and 1 (OPEN)  
**Already closing/closed:** States 2 (CLOSING) and 3 (CLOSED)

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Normal Connection
```typescript
✅ Expected behavior:
1. connect() called
2. _isConnected = true on success
3. Heartbeat starts
4. Console: "Connected to ROS2 Command Center"
```

### Test 2: Connection Error
```typescript
✅ Expected behavior:
1. connect() called with wrong IP
2. onerror fires
3. _isConnected = false immediately
4. onclose does NOT fire (handler removed)
5. Console: "Connection error for rover..."
6. Promise rejected
```

### Test 3: Disconnect
```typescript
✅ Expected behavior:
1. disconnect() called
2. _isConnected = false immediately
3. Heartbeat stops
4. Socket handlers removed
5. Socket closed
6. Single state change notification
7. Console: "Disconnected from ROS2 Command Center"
```

### Test 4: Rapid Reconnection
```typescript
✅ Expected behavior:
1. connect() called
2. Immediately disconnect() called
3. Immediately connect() called again
4. Old socket cleaned up
5. New socket created
6. No duplicate connections
7. No memory leaks
```

### Test 5: Network Loss During Connection
```typescript
✅ Expected behavior:
1. Connected successfully (_isConnected = true)
2. Unplug network cable
3. onerror fires
4. _isConnected = false immediately
5. Heartbeat stops
6. Single state change notification
7. Console shows error with rover ID
```
